                                Joel Hilton is a lifelong film enthusiast with strong opinions and a
                                carefully curated movie collection.

                            <p>
                                He minored in Film Studies at Brigham Young University and currently
                                works as a contracted movie reviewer for ClearPlay, where he evaluates
                                films with a thoughtful and critical eye.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In addition to reviewing movies, Joel co-hosts a weekly podcast called
                                <a href="https://baconsale.com/" target="_blank">Baconsale</a>, where he
                                discusses films, pop culture, and other important life topics with humor
                                and insight.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                When he’s not watching movies or recording podcasts, Joel performs
                                regularly with
                                <a href="https://www.qwcomedy.com/" target="_blank">Quick Wits Comedy</a>,
                                blending his love of storytelling with live improv comedy.

                                Joel only collects movies he truly deems worthy—though he admits he may
                                have “married into” a few along the way.
